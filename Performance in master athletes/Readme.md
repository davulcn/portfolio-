231 of the master athletes that competed in the 2018 World Masters Athletics Track and Field Championships (Malaga) were recruited by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to complete a body composition assessment and two vertical jump tests, the countermovement jump test (CMJ) and hopping test. This analysis focuses on predicting performance based on the collected measures. The results could be of use for future athletic assessment and placement of masters athletes.
